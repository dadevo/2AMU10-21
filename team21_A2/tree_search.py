class Node:

    father : Node
        the parent of the current Node in the search tree
    children : list
        the list of children of the current Node in the search tree
    our_move : boolean
        Stores whether it is currently our move (True) or the enemies' move (False)
    full_board : boolean
        Stores whether the board is currently full (so that no new moves can be made)

    Methods
